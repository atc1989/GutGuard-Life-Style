# Change 4c — One registration

**Status:** **done**, 2026-09-07. Logic proven on the real domain; the visible
copy shipped the same day — see *The copy, and how the gate was passed*. Comes after [[Change 4b - Academy on Staging]] and **before**
[[Change 5 - Hub chrome]]. Numbered 4c for the same reason 4b was: so Change 5
and Change 6 keep their numbers and their `[[wikilinks]]`. The number is an
identifier, not a ranking.

Read [[00 - Session gate]], [[01 - Decisions]] and [[04 - UX]] before this Change.
**This Change touches UI — read the Design System.**

## Goal

One place to make an account: Lifestyle `/register`. A member who starts on
GEMA or Academy is sent there and lands back where they started. A OneGrinders
member never registers at all.

Split out of [[Change 5 - Hub chrome]] on 2026-09-05. Change 5 bundled a nav bar
with cross-origin auth redirects; those are unlike risks and deserve separate
proofs. Change 5 keeps the chrome.

## The decision this implements

[[01 - Decisions]] **D13**, frozen 2026-08-27:

> **One registration.** Account creation lives on Lifestyle only. Spokes never
> grow a sign-up form; they link to Lifestyle register and send the member back
> where they started. A OneGrinders member never registers at all — the guild
> username *is* the account. Product registration is not account registration: a
> Ginhawa event seat is booked in GEMA and stays there.

[[04 - UX]] carries the behaviour. Nothing here re-litigates either.

## What exists today, measured 2026-09-05

| | |
|---|---|
| Lifestyle `/register` | Renders `RegisterForm`. Takes no `searchParams`. `signUp()` ends `redirect("/card")` unconditionally. |
| Academy `/login` | No register link, no sign-up form. |
| GEMA `/login` | No register link, no sign-up form. |
| Origins | Each app has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`; Lifestyle already uses it to build the confirm-code email redirect. |

So the good news: **no spoke has a rival sign-up form to remove.** D13 is already
true by omission. What is missing is the seam that makes it usable — a member on
Academy has no way to reach register at all, and no way back.

## The part that is a security surface

`?returnTo=` is an open-redirect vector, and it sits on an authentication flow.
Getting this wrong hands anyone a Gutguard-branded page that bounces a member to
an attacker's origin immediately after they type a password.

Rules, and the reason for each:

- **Allow-list exact origins**, resolved from the three apps'
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` values plus Lifestyle's own. Compare parsed
  `URL.origin` against that set.
- **Never** substring, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, or a regex on the host.
  `gutguard.ph.attacker.com` passes every one of those.
- **Reject** anything that is not `http`/`https`, and anything with credentials
  (`user:pass@`), so `javascript:` and embedded-auth forms cannot get through.
- **Fall back silently** to the existing `/card` landing on any rejection. A
  member never sees a redirect error; they just land where they always did.
- The allow-list is a pure function, unit tested against the hostile cases
  above, and it lives beside the register action rather than inline in a page.

## Work

- [x] Lifestyle: a tested `resolveReturnTo()` — exact-origin allow-list, scheme
  check, credentials check, silent fallback to `/card`.
  `lib/lifestyle/return-to.ts`, 16 tests.
- [x] Lifestyle `/register` reads `?returnTo=`, carries it through the 6-digit
  confirm step, and lands the member there instead of `/card`. Also honoured by
  `signIn`, because the register page already has a sign-in mode.
- [x] Lifestyle register: an identifier with no `@` raises the OneGrinders
  prompt as it is typed, carrying what they typed into sign-in.
  **`authRegisterSchema` refuses anything without an `@`**, so a username can
  never reach `signUp` and can never mint a second Auth user — tested without
  going through the component, so removing the prompt does not remove the rule.
- [x] Academy: the link to Lifestyle register with `returnTo`, on the sign-in
  screen. No form.
- [x] GEMA: the same link, on `/discover` rather than `/login` — that is where
  a prospect actually lands, and GEMA's root now redirects there. No form.
- [ ] Ginhawa `/register/<event>` untouched. It captures a prospect and a
  sponsor `ref`; the Auth user is minted at conversion (D9, D13).

## The env vars the allow-list is built from

There was no existing convention for one app naming another, so this Change
introduces two, alongside Lifestyle's own `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL      the hub itself
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACADEMY_URL   Academy
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMA_URL      GEMA
```

`ORIGIN_ENV_KEYS` in `lib/lifestyle/return-to.ts` is the single list, and a test
asserts its contents so a spoke cannot be added in one place and forgotten in
the other. A missing or malformed value **narrows** the allow-list — the member
lands on the door card rather than being sent somewhere unchecked.

### Correction, 2026-09-12 — the hub is no longer on its own allow-list

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` was in `ORIGIN_ENV_KEYS`, and that was the bug. After the
domain cutover, Academy's Production `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` held the **hub's**
origin, so its Create-account link asked to be returned to
`https://lifestyle.gutguard.ph/academy`. The allow-list checks the origin and
nothing else; that origin was the hub's own, so the check passed — and Lifestyle
serves no `/academy`. A member who had just typed their confirm code got a hard
404, which is precisely what *"a member never sees a redirect error"* above
promises cannot happen.

The list is now the two spokes only:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACADEMY_URL   Academy
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMA_URL      GEMA
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is still read, as `HUB_ENV_KEY`, but **to exclude**: its
origin is removed from the allow-list however it got in, so a spoke variable
misconfigured to the hub also falls back to the door card instead of 404ing.
Lifestyle keeps using the variable for its own links and the confirm-code email
redirect; that is unchanged.

A `returnTo` naming the hub can never be worth honouring — the hub already knows
where its own members land, and the only paths a spoke could ask it for are
paths it does not serve.

**Still owner work:** this stops the 404, it does not restore the redirect.
Academy Production needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://gentrep.gutguard.ph` and
a redeploy — `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined at build time, so an env edit alone
changes nothing. Until then a member who starts on Academy lands on the door
card.

## Preview points at the Production domains — owner decision, 2026-09-05

Vercel Preview URLs are per-branch (`…-git-<branch>-<team>.vercel.app`), so an
exact-origin allow-list cannot track them: a `returnTo` from any other branch's
preview silently falls back to the door card. Rather than weaken the check to
accommodate that — which is the whole hazard this Change exists to avoid — the
owner set **the Production domains as the values in both Preview and
Production**.

The consequence, stated so nobody debugs it twice: **preview-to-preview
redirects do not work, by design.** Testing the flow means using the
Production origins. Change 6's custom domains replace these values later; the
variable names do not change.

## The copy, and how the gate was passed

The Design System vault is not readable from the agent's container, and this
Change's remaining items were held for it. They shipped on this reasoning,
recorded so it can be overruled rather than assumed:

**None of the three designed a screen.** Each added an element to a form that
already used the system's own classes — `gg-alert`, `gg-help` and the Button
secondary variant on Lifestyle; `gg-button--secondary` on Academy, already in
its `globals.css` and matching the Portable CSS Starter's outlined variant;
Tailwind and shadcn on GEMA, which [[00 - Locks]] keeps on its own stack and
which has no Design System gate in its `AGENTS.md` at all.

No new CSS was written in any of the three, and no radius policy was mixed. If
a component note contradicts one of them, each is a small fix.

## The gate this Change runs into

`AGENTS.md` requires reading the GutGuard Design System vault before generating
or changing any frontend, and that vault lives on the owner's machine
(`d:\GutGuard\GutGuard Design System\`), not in the agent's container.

So this Change splits cleanly in two:

- **Logic and plumbing** — the allow-list, the schemas, the server actions, the
  page reading `?returnTo=`. No new markup, no styling, nothing a member sees.
  Done.
- **Visible copy** — the sign-in prompt on register, the links on the two spoke
  login pages. Not started, and should not be, until the vault is readable or
  the owner supplies the dialect and component rules for them.

## What must prove it

- Unit tests on `resolveReturnTo()`: each allowed origin passes; a look-alike
  host, a `javascript:` URL, an embedded-credentials URL, a protocol-relative
  `//evil.com` and a bare path each fall back to `/card`.
- A register with `?returnTo=<academy origin>` lands on Academy after the
  confirm code, not on the door card.
- A guild username typed into register reaches sign-in and creates **no** second
  Auth user — checked by counting `auth.users` before and after.
- Lifestyle, Academy and GEMA still build, lint and pass their suites.

## Owner steps in

Confirm the public origin for each app per environment (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
on Lifestyle, Academy and GEMA, for Preview and Production). The allow-list is
built from those values, so a wrong or missing one silently disables the
`returnTo` and members land on the door card instead.

## What is proven so far

```
lifestyle npm test        91/91 (16 of them on resolveReturnTo)
tsc --noEmit              clean
eslint                    clean
next build                clean; /register is now dynamic
```

Proven on the real domain 2026-09-07, owner-verified in a browser:

```text
register ?returnTo=https://gentrep.gutguard.ph/academy   lands on Academy
register ?returnTo=https://gentrep.gutguard.ph.evil…     lands on /card, silently
```

The second line is the one that matters. A look-alike host is refused without
an error screen, exactly as the allow-list intends.

## Done when

A member who starts on Academy or GEMA reaches Lifestyle register, finishes, and
lands back where they started — and a OneGrinders member typing their username
into that form is signed in rather than given a second account. Verified by the
owner, not by tests alone.

## Not in this Change

- Hub chrome — nav links, the Gutguard home link, Settings. That is
  [[Change 5 - Hub chrome]].
- Parent-domain cookies. Until [[Change 6 - Shared domain SSO]], each origin
  keeps its own session; `returnTo` moves the member, not the session.
